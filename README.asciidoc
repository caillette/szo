== At a glance

Szótárgép means "vocabulary machine" in Magyar (Hungarian). It is a standalone application for learning Magyar from French.

It's a small piece of HTML and JavaScript, essentially using JQuery. Vocabulary files are text files that anybody can edit.


== Supported configurations

* Safari 5.1 on Mac OS X 10.6.8: works fine.
* Firefox 6.0 on Mac OS X 10.6.8: works fine. Doesn't support printing more than one page.
* Chrome 13 on Mac OS X 10.6.8: works fine with the special option described below.

It's likely that any version of Internet Explorer won't work.

=== Running with Chrome

To say things simply, Chrome forbids access to the local filesystem by default. To circumvent this, launch Chrome like this:

Mac OS X:
[source]
$ /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --allow-file-access-from-files

Windows:
[source]
> chrome.exe --allow-file-access-from-files
